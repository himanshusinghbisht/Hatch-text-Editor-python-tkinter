# Hatch Text Editor in Python 
Hatch -v 1.1
Hatch Text Editor

use it for serving your purpose

Now Hatch can also be used as an IDE,for running python and c++ files!!

It's a simple IDE , it just doesn't support i\o functionality.

The IDE wont' work on windows os , it's just for unix based systems.

For windows Hatch is just another cool Text-Editor, but it's quite more than

that . 
For Unix based systems , Hatch is and IDE + Text-Editor!
